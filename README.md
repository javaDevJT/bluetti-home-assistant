BLUETTI Power Station Integration is an integrated component of Home Assistant
supported by BLUETTI official. It allows you to use BLUETTI smart Power Station
devices in Home Assistant.

The Integration's github repository is:
[https://github.com/javaDevJT/bluetti-home-assistant](https://github.com/javaDevJT/bluetti-home-assistant).

This fork adds read-only Hub A1 support for Apex 300 systems that BLUETTI's
Home Assistant `/devices` API does not currently list. Hub A1 support is based
on BLUETTI app API telemetry discovered from live account captures and does not
use the `bindDevices` write endpoint for manually entered Hub A1 serials.
